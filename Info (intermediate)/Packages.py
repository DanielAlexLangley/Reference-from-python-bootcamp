A python package is different from a module since a python package is...
...a whole bunch of code/lots of files other people have written...
...all packaged together for a goal or purpose.

Search for packages on PyPi
https://pypi.org/
This is an index we can pull packages from.

For example:
https://pypi.org/project/prettytable/
