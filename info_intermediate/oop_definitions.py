The old way of programming was called procedural programming.
I have no notes about that old way.
New way of programming is object oriented programming.
AKA OOP

A "class" is the blueprint and type.
An "object" is generated from the class.
We create a class so that we can create as many objects from it as needed.

An "attribute" is a variable in a class/object.
A "method" is a function in a class/object.

To create a new object from a class looks like:
car = CarBlueprint()
"car" is the object.
"CarBlueprint()" is the class.

Capitalise first letter of each word in a class.
This is called "Pascal Case".
Correct: BluePrint()
Incorrect: Blue_Print()

When making an object, most people name the object the same as the class (except using snake casing).
So an object made from "CarBlueprint()" would probably be named car_blueprint
