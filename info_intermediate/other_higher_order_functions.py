# Higher order functions

# Idea is that it's a function that can work with other functions.
# So onkey() is a higher order function since it can take another
# function as an input then working with it inside its body.
# It's very useful when we need to listen for events then trigger a particular function.
# This is commonly used in Python.

# When using methods you haven't created yourself (like onkey) to use
# keyword arguments rather than position, especially if the position has no meaning.

# See App turtle_etch_a_sketch for an example
