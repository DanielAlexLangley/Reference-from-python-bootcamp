# One of the most popular ways to transfer data across the internet.
# It looks similar to a dictionary.
# It's essentially composed of nested lists and dictionaries.
# It has that key:value data structure.

# Python has a json library built in:
# To write, use json.dump()
# To read, use json.load()
# To update, use json.update()

# When you use json.dump(), the data is converted into json for storage.
# When you use json.load(), the data returns to a Python dictionary.
