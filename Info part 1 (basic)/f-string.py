# f-string

score = 0  # int
height = 1.8  # float
isWinning = True  # boolean
print(f"Your score is {score}, your height is {height}, you are winning is {isWinning}.")


# another way to do f-string is into a variable, like:

whatever1 = 50
whatever2 = 100
example_variable = f"The first number is {whatever1}, and the second number is {whatever2}."
print(example_variable)
