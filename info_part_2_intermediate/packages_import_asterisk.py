# We can import everything from a module by using the asterisk:

from turtle import *

tim = Turtle()

# It can be confusing to import everything, since you may not know where methods come from when you use them later on.
# Because of this confusion, it's unusual in the Python community to write code like this.
# Most good programmers won't use this asterisk version.
