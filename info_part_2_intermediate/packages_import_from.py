# If we use the turtle class a lot, then it would be easier to write it like:
# from module_name import thing_in_module
from turtle import Turtle
# If we write it like that, we can just write:
tim = Turtle()  # rather than have to write tim = turtle.Turtle() so much,
# since we could be making many turtles like tom = Turtle() and terry = Turtle().
